This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type error: passing an array of strings to a function that expects a single string. The bug.ts file contains the buggy code, while the bugSolution.ts file contains the corrected code.  The error highlights the importance of type checking in TypeScript and how to correctly handle arrays when working with functions that expect single values.
